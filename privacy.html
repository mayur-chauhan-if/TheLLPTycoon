<h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Users</h2><p>Like most website operators, MTara Apps collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MTara Apps's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MTara Apps's visitors use its website. From time to time, MTara Apps may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>MTara Apps also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged-in users and for users leaving comments on https://mayur-chauhan-if.github.io/TheLLPTycoon/ blog posts. MTara Apps only discloses logged-in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Certain visitors to MTara Apps's websites choose to interact with MTara Apps in ways that require MTara Apps to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that MTara Apps gathers depend on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at https://mayur-chauhan-if.github.io/TheLLPTycoon/ to provide a username and email address.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Remarketing">5. MTara Apps uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
<p>MTara Apps uses remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site.

Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.</p>
